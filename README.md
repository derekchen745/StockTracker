# StockTracker

A program that scraped the price of a stock from Google Finance and outputs a variety of information such as:

1. A text file that contains:
  ** The date the information was gathered 
  ** The previous closing price of the stock
  ** The current price of the stock
  ** The daily highs, lows and average price of the stock
 
2. A png file that contains a line graph of the changes in price of the stock throughout the day

3. A excel file that contains the price of the stock each time the information was gathered

The "Resulting Files" folder includes the resulting files from the program which was run on January 5, 2022 from 1:05 to 5:05 at 15 minute intervals (user given)
